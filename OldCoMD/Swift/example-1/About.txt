= CoMD/Swift: Example 1

== File index

+About.txt+:: This file

+CoMD-simple.swift+:: The Swift script: calls into CoMD

+CoMDSwift.swift+:: The Swift header file: declares CoMD functions

+build.sh+:: Compiles the C code to build the Swift package

+comdswift.h+:: Header file: exposes C functions to Swift

+comdswift.c+:: Implementation of C functions callable by Swift.
                These are simple short wrappers around the CoMD core
                functions.

+comdswift.i+:: SWIG interface file: compatible with +comdswift.h+

== Usage

. Install SWIG, Turbine, STC
. Compile CoMD with shared libraries
+
----
cd CoMD
patch -p0 < Swift/patches/shared-library.diff
make clean
rm CMakeCache.txt
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=true
make
----

. Build the Swift package
+
First, edit +build.sh+ to set +CoMD_HOME+. Then:
+
----
cd CoMD/Swift/example-1
./build.sh
----
+
The build script should be easy to customize.  Use +set -x+ to debug.

. Compile and run the Swift script
+
----
./test-CoMD-simple.sh
----

== Todos

. Do something interesting with virial stress output
. Try to minimize file I/O- replace with in-memory data passing
  through Swift
. Run at larger concurrency
. Do something with YAML files- Swift is good at this kind of thing
